Spatial Audio Painting is a painting board which is correlated to the sound variations in space. When you paint on the canvas, the spatial position of the audio source will be changed as you paint in different locations. 

The pigment you use for spatial painting is controlled by Playback Rate and Ambience sliders. When Playback Rate is equal to 1, it plays sounds in the original pace. When you change the value of Playback Rate to 2, the sound will be played two times faster, and vice verse. The Ambience is used to control the room reverbarations of the spatial sound. The Cutoff Frequency controls the amount of your pigment. When your sound is filtered by a low-pass filter, you get less pigment than usual. The lower the Cutoff Frequency, the less of the amount of pigment. 

The Sounds module offers many options for audio sources. The Acoustic Spaces module offers the options of room reverbaration effects.
